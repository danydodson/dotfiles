# Username and Group Management Cheat Sheet

## Change Username

### Change the Username of an Existing User

```bash
sudo usermod -l "new-name" "old-name"
```

- **Note:** This command changes the login name of a user but does not change the home directory or other associated files.

### Change the Home Directory of a User

```bash
sudo usermod -d "/new/userhome" -m "username"
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The `-d` flag specifies the new home directory.
  - The `-m` flag moves the content of the old home directory to the new one.

### Create Symlinks for Old Hardcoded Paths

```bash
sudo ln -s "/new/userhome" "/old/userhome"
```

- **Purpose:** Create symbolic links to ensure that old paths referencing the user's previous home directory still work.

### Update Sudoers with New Username

```bash
sudo visudo
```

- **Instructions:**
  - Manually update any occurrences of the old username in the sudoers file to reflect the new username.
  - Be cautious when editing the sudoers file, as syntax errors can result in loss of sudo access.

### List All Files Using Old Username

```bash
grep -r "old_username" /etc/*
```

- **Explanation:**
  - This command searches recursively (`-r`) through configuration files to find instances of the old username.
  - Modify paths or files manually if necessary.

## Group Management

### Add a User to a Group

```bash
sudo gpasswd -a "username" "group"
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The `-a` flag adds the user to the specified group.

### Remove a User from a Group

```bash
sudo gpasswd -d "username" "group"
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The `-d` flag deletes the user from the specified group.

### Change Group Name

```bash
sudo groupmod -n "new_group" "old_group"
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The `-n` flag allows you to rename a group.

### Change Primary Group of a User

```bash
sudo usermod -g "new_group" "username"
```

- **Explanation:**
  - This command changes the primary group of the specified user to `new_group`.

## Additional Considerations

### Ensure All Files Are Properly Owned by the User

```bash
sudo find / -user "old_username" -exec chown -h "new_username" {} \;
```

- **Explanation:**
  - This command finds all files owned by the old username and changes ownership to the new username.

### Update Crontab for the New Username

```bash
sudo crontab -e -u "new_username"
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Ensure that any cron jobs for the user are correctly set up under the new username.

### Update Any System Services or Applications

- **Instructions:**
  - If the old username is referenced in system services, scripts, or applications, ensure these references are updated to avoid potential issues.

### Backup and Validation

- **Backup:** Before making any significant changes, it's wise to back up critical data and configuration files.
- **Validation:** After making changes, validate by logging in as the new user, ensuring all configurations, services, and permissions function as expected.
