### GPG üîê

GPG is an implementation of [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org).

#### Installation

- Install `gnupg`:
  - macOS: `brew install gnupg`
  - Ubuntu Linux: `sudo apt-get install gnupg`
  - Manually: [Download from GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html)
- Install `pinentry`:
  - macOS: `brew install pinentry` (terminal) or `brew install pinentry-mac` ([app](https://github.com/GPGTools/pinentry-mac) from [GPGTools suite](https://gpgtools.org/) that enables use of macOS keychain and GUI apps like VSCode)
  - Ubuntu Linux: `apt install pinentry`
  - Manually: On macOS, Apple's command-line tools (`xcode-select`) should have the build prerequisites. [Download](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html) `libgpg-error`, `libassuan`, and `pinentry`, then build from source and install in order (`libgpg-error`, then `libassuan`, then `pinentry`):
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/libgpg-error
    ./configure; make; sudo make install
    cd /path/to/libassuan
    ./configure; make; sudo make install
    cd /path/to/pinentry
    ./configure; make; sudo make install
    ```
- Set the `pinentry` program:
  - _~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:_ `pinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-tty`
  - The path apparently has to be absolute, so it may vary by system.
  - See the [GPG agent options docs](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Agent-Options.html) for more.
  - `pinentry-tty` allows plain-text password entry. `pinentry` may raise confusing "Screen or window too small" errors in some terminals.
- [Export the `GPG_TTY` environment variable](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Agent-Examples.html): `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` (can add to shell profile to automatically export). Note that this is not the same thing as `export GPG_TTY=$TTY`, which may raise cryptic `Inappropriate ioctl for device` errors.
- Ensure proper permissions are set on GPG config files:
  ```sh
  chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
  chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
  ```
- See the [GPG configuration docs](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/GPG-Configuration.html) for more.

#### GPG and YubiKey

Resources:

- [`gpg-card` docs](https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/gpg_002dcard.html)
- [Yubico developers: PGP](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/)
- [Yubico support: using your YubiKey with OpenPGP](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790259-Using-Your-YubiKey-with-OpenPGP)
- [YubiKey Manager CLI (`ykman`) User Manual](https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/Using_the_ykman_CLI.html)
- [Okta developer blog: Developers guide to GPG and YubiKey](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/07/07/developers-guide-to-gpg)

A YubiKey has admin and non-admin OpenPGP PINs.

- Default OpenPGP admin PIN is 12345678.
- Default OpenPGP non-admin PIN is 123456.
- Change OpenPGP PINs with `gpg --change-pin` or `ykman openpgp access change-admin-pin`/`ykman openpgp access change-pin`.

To use a GPG key on a YubiKey with a new computer, plug in the YubiKey, check the status, and fetch the public keys.

```text
~
‚ùØ gpg --card-status

~
‚ùØ gpg --card-edit

gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed

gpg/card> url
URL to retrieve public key: https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.gpg

gpg/card> fetch

gpg/card> quit
```

To move a GPG key from a computer to a YubiKey, use `gpg --edit-key` followed by `keytocard`. The `keytocard` command is repeated for each "where to store the key" option. After the two `keytocard` commands, there may be confusing output regarding whether or not to "save" your changes, including `Note: the local copy of the secret key will only be deleted with "save".` As recommended in [Yubico support: using your YubiKey with OpenPGP](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790259-Using-Your-YubiKey-with-OpenPGP), entering "no" at these prompts will avoid deleting the GPG key from the computer (but will still save it to the YubiKey).

#### GPG key generation

- Run `gpg --full-generate-key` from the command line to generate a key. Respond to the command-line prompts. The maximum key size of `4096` is recommended.
- View keys with `gpg --list-secret-keys`.
- Run `gpg --send-keys <keynumber>` to share the public key with the GPG database. It takes about 10 minutes for the key to show up in the GPG database.

#### Key import and export

- Import a GPG key from a file: `gpg --import /path/to/privatekey.asc`
- Export your GPG public key:
  - Copy to clipboard (for pasting into GitHub/GitLab): `gpg --armor --export | pbcopy`
  - Export to a file: `gpg --armor --export > public.gpg`

#### Sending messages

- Locate another user's key in the global database with `gpg --search-keys <email>`.
- Encrypting communications
  - Encrypt a message with `echo "Hello, World!" | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient "<email>"`. Optionally, save the encrypted message in a .gpg file.
  - If the message was saved in a file, send the file over email, Slack, or any other medium.
  - Decrypt the message with `gpg --decrypt`.
    - If copying the encrypted text directly, include it in quotes: `echo "BIG LONG GPG STRING" | gpg --decrypt`.
    - If reading a file, include the filename when decrypting: `gpg --decrypt message.gpg`.
    - Decrypted output can be autosaved to a new file: `gpg --decrypt message.gpg --output file.txt`.

#### Signing Git commits with GPG

Note that SSH can also be used to sign Git commits. See the [SSH section](#ssh) for further details.

- See [Pro Git: Signing your work](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work).
- Install and configure `pinentry` as described above.
- Configure Git to use GPG and your key for commits, using _.gitconfig_:
  - Set `signingkey`: `git config --global user.signingkey 16digit_PGPkeyid` the 16 digit PGP key id is the partial 16 digit number listed on the `sec` line).
    ```ini
    [user]
    name = your name
    email = you@email.com
    signingkey = 16digit_PGPkeyid
    ```
  - Turn on `gpgsign`:
    ```ini
    [commit]
    gpgsign = true
    ```

#### General

- Start the agent: `gpg-connect-agent /bye`
- Reload the agent configuration: `gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye`
- Stop the agent: `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent` or `gpgconf --kill all`. See the [GPG docs on invoking `gpg-agent`](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT.html).
- Verify GPG signing capabilities: `echo "test" | gpg --clearsign`
- Trust GPG keys using the GPG TTY interface:
  - If you see `gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!` when examining signed Git commits with `git log --show-signature`, you may want to trust the keys.
  - Enter the GPG key editor from the command line with `gpg --edit-key <PGPkeyid>`.
  - Set trust level for the key by typing `trust`, hitting enter, and entering a trust level.
  - See the [GPG docs](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html) for more info.

- [GitLab GPG instructions](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/index.md)
- If working on a server, you can use [ssh agent forwarding](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/overview/using-ssh-agent-forwarding) to access your SSH and GPG keys without having to copy them.
